The hyper2D_hypersonic folder contains a non-equilibrium two-temperatures solver for the 
Euler equations. Two temperatures are considered: a roto-translational temperature T and
a vibrational temperature Tv. These temperatures relax following the Landau-Teller model.

The time scales for vibrational relaxation can be very fast. Therefore, implicit time
integration could be preferred in some conditions. The directory "other_files" contains
both an explicit and a point-implicit integration scheme. The point-implicit scheme
is only done on the vibrational energy equation, since the source term for the other 
equations is zero.

A Cartesian grid is used, and a flat plate is introduced inside the domain.
All input data is specified inside the global_module.f03 file. You can modify it there, then
compile and run the code.

==================================
= COMPILING AND RUNNING THE CODE =
==================================

For compiling the code, go into the src directory and type "make".
This will create the 'hyper2d.exe' executable file. 
Copy it to the desired location and run it with:

$ ./hyper2d.exe

*****
***** NOTE THAT hyper2d WILL ATTEMPT TO WRITE THE OUTPUT INSIDE A LOCAL "dumps"
***** DIRECTORY. YOU NEED TO CREATE IT!

=========================
= STRUCTURE OF THE CODE =
=========================

The hyper2d.f03 contains the main program.
The global settings are implemented in the global_module.f03 file.
The PDEs are implemented in the pde.f03 file.
The time integrator and the computation of numerical fluxes are inside integrator.f03.
The routine for exporting to VTK is in tools.f03.

The program goes like this:
1) The solution is initialized (calling pde.f03)
2) Boundary conditions are applied (calling pde.f03)
3) Time integration starts (calling integration.f03)
  3.1) Numerical fluxes are computed 
  3.2) The solution is updated in time
4) The solution is exported (calling tools.f03)
