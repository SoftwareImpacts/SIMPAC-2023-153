This directory contains a higher order implementation of the basic hyper2D solver. 
Please refer to the previous directories for a full description. 

A Cartesian grid is employed, and no objects are introduced into the domain. 
Notice that four ghost cells are employed for each side of the domain.
This allows to reach up to 5th accuracy at the boundaries (with WENO).
We provide the following possibilities:

SPACE INTEGRATION

- Second order in space, using van Leer's MUSCL linear reconstruction with TVD slope limiter. 

- Third order in space, with WENO method

- Fifth order in space, with WENO method

TIME INTEGRATION (explicit steppers)

- First order, forward Euler

- Second order, midpoint Euler

- Third order, TVD Runge-Kutta

These options are chosen via parameters in the global_module file.

==================================
= COMPILING AND RUNNING THE CODE =
==================================

For compiling the code, go into the src directory and type "make".
This will create the 'hyper2d.exe' executable file. 
Copy it to the desired location and run it with:

$ ./hyper2d.exe

*****
***** NOTE THAT hyper2d WILL ATTEMPT TO WRITE THE OUTPUT INSIDE A LOCAL "dumps"
***** DIRECTORY. YOU NEED TO CREATE IT!
