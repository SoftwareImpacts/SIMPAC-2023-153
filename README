Hyper2D is designed to be as simple as possible and suitable for teaching purposes.
You will find in this directory various versions of Hyper2D, with increasing capabilities and complexity.
Each version is completely independent.

Here is a summary:

# PDE1D

  This is a simple one-dimensional finite volume solver, implemented in Octave/MATLAB,
  aimed at familiarizing with the Finite Volume Method. It solves the Euler equations 
  for the Sod shock tube problem.

# hyper2D_basic

  This is the simplest implementation of Hyper2D, in Fortran. It includes the Shallow 
  Water equations and the Euler equations (either with constant specific heat or with 
  molecular vibration for diatomic molecules). You will find these files in the 
  "various_PDEs" directory. You just have to rename the files  pde_shallow_water.f03 
  or pde_euler.f03 to "pde.f03", put it in the main "src" directory and compile.
 
  This version of Hyper2D solves the problem in a Cartesian grid, using a first order 
  method  in space and explicit in time. A spatially second order version, using 
  van Leer's MUSCL approach and TVD slope limiter is available in a sub-directory.
 
  The domain is empty, and one can study the effect of boundaries or initialize the 
  solution with a non-trivial initial state and track its evolution.


# hyper2D_flatplate

  This version builds on hyper2D_basic and introduces a flat plate inside the domain.
 
# hyper2D_hypersonic

  This directory contains a non-equilibrium two-temperatures solver for the Euler 
  equations, targeted at hypersonic simulations. Two temperatures are considered: 
  a roto-translational temperature T and a vibrational temperature Tv. 
  These temperatures relax following the Landau-Teller model.
  
  The time scales for vibrational relaxation can be very fast. Therefore, implicit time
  integration could be preferred in some conditions. The directory "other_files" contains
  both an explicit and a point-implicit integration scheme. The point-implicit scheme
  is only done on the vibrational energy equation, since the source term for the other
  equations is zero.

# hyper2D_unstructured
  
  This version reads an unstructured grid of quadrilaterals in SU2 format. The grid
  is pre-processed using some Octave/MATLAB tools available in the "mesh_preprocessing"
  directory, resulting in a "mesh.hyp" and a "nodes.hyp" files that are intelligible 
  by Hyper2D.

# hyper2D_CUDA
 
  This version is written in CUDA Fortran and allows you to run Hyper2D on an NVidia
  GPU. The code runs on a single GPU.
