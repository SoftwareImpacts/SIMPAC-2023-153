This folder contains the Octave/MATLAB solver "PDE1D", that
demonstrates the finite volume method in 1-dimension for the 
Euler equations.

The solution is initialized as a Riemann problem, showing 
two initially uniform states separated by a discontinuity 
(Sod shock tube problem).

Open Octave/MATLAB and run the main.m script.
