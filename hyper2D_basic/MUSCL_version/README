This directory contains a spatially second order implementation of the basic hyper2D solver. 
Please refer to the previous directories for a full description. 

A Cartesian grid is employed, and no objects are introduced into the domain. 


** Second order in space **
With respect to the basic version, here the solution at the interface is estimated using 
linear reconstruction (van Leer's MUSCL approach), slope-limited a TVD limiter.
The reconstruction is performed in primitive variables.

==================================
= COMPILING AND RUNNING THE CODE =
==================================

For compiling the code, go into the src directory and type "make".
This will create the 'hyper2d.exe' executable file. 
Copy it to the desired location and run it with:

$ ./hyper2d.exe

*****
***** NOTE THAT hyper2d WILL ATTEMPT TO WRITE THE OUTPUT INSIDE A LOCAL "dumps"
***** DIRECTORY. YOU NEED TO CREATE IT!
